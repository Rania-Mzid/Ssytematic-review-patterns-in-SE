  abstract = {Raising the design abstraction level has been, since many years, a prominent solution to decrease the complexity of selfadaptive real time embedded systems (RTES) and increase productivity. However, the manual specification and integration of the adaptive behavior into the system model is still presenting a big handicap for designers. There is a lack of Computer Aided Software Engineering tools and methodologies that permit to automate the generation of self-adaptive RTES models. Therefore, designers need an expertise in the adaptation domain as well as the modeling language and much time for manual work. At the aim of solving these problems, we propose, in this paper, a Model Driven Engineering based approach that permits to guide the automatic transformation of a classic Y-chart RTES model into a self-adaptive model based on design patterns. A model-based interactive process is developed to enable the generation of self-adaptive models for RTES based on the instantiation, integration and specialization of design patterns. The generated system model is then mapped to the input of a simulation platform in order to perform the non-functional properties verification and simulate the system reconfiguration, if needed. The proposed approach is tested and validated through a case study of an embedded video conferencing system which is CPU and network bandwidth-constrained.},

  abstract = {The development of self-adaptive real-time embedded (RTE) systems is an increasingly hard task due to the growing complexity of both hardware and software and the high variability of the execution environment. Different approaches, platforms, and middleware have been proposed in the field, from low to high abstraction level. However, there is still a lack of generic and reusable designs for self-adaptive RTE systems that fit different system domains, lighten designers' task, and decrease development cost. In this paper, we propose five design patterns for self-adaptive RTE systems modeling resulting from the generalization of relevant existing adaptation-related works. Combined together, the patterns form the design of an adaptation loop composed of five adaptation modules. The proposed solution offers a modular, reusable, and flexible specification of these modules and enables the separation of concerns. It also permits dealing with concurrency, real-time features, and adaptation cost relative to the adaptation activities. To validate our solution, we applied it to a complex case study, a cross-layer self-adaptive object tracking system, to show patterns utilization and prove the solution benefits.},

  abstract = {Today's systems require a higher consideration for non functional requirements as security and dependability. Developers have to handle these requirements during software development lifecycle. To provide developers with security guidelines, security patterns were proposed. These patterns are a collection of experts' security knowledge and a good solution to convey security concepts. In order to encourage developers to take advantage from security solutions proposed by security patterns, we think that it is necessary to provide an appropriate mechanism to implement those patterns using UML profiles. In this paper, we propose a structured UML profiles construction process based on security patterns. An illustration of the proposed process is provided using the ``active replication'' pattern. A case study of GPS system is also provided to demonstrate the application of generated UML profile using the proposed process.},

SCRIP defines activities and products to integrate security patterns in the whole development process, from UML component modeling until aspect code generation. The definition of SCRIP has been made using the OMG standard Software and System Process Engineering Meta-model (SPEM). We are developing a CASE tool to support that process.},

MDA is also based on the concepts of metamodel, automatic transformation and traceability. A crucial part of the evolution from abstract models to executable components or applications is accomplished by means of refactoring. In this paper we propose a refactoring specification based on patterns and metamodeling techniques. We describe foundations for MDA-based refactoring that allow extending the functionality of the existing CASE tools in order to improve the MDA-based process quality.},

We investigate scheduling analysis of multi-tasks applications running on real-time operating systems (RTOS in this article). Scheduling analysis on these types of system can be performed with the real-time scheduling theory, but applying it is a complicated task. To allow designer to automatically apply this theory, we propose several architectural design patterns. Each architectural design pattern models a classical task synchronization or communication protocol available in RTOSes. In this article, we focus on those design patterns composition. We show how to compose the proposed design patterns and how scheduling analysis can be run with them.},

  abstract = {Software analysis pattern is an approach of software reuse which provides a way to reuse expertise that can be used across domains at early level of development. Developing software for a mobile robot system involves multi-disciplines expert knowledge which includes embedded systems, real-time software issues, control theories and artificial intelligence aspects. This paper focuses on analysis patterns as a means to facilitate mobile robot software knowledge reuse by capturing conceptual models in those domains in order to allow reuse across applications. The use of software analysis patterns as a means to facilitate Autonomous Mobile Robots (AMR) software knowledge reuse through component-based software engineering is proposed. The software analysis patterns for AMR were obtained through a pattern mining process, and documented using a standard catalogue template. These analysis patterns are categorized according to hybrid deliberate layered architecture of robot software: Reactive layer, supervisor layer and deliberative layer. Particularly, the analysis patterns in the reactive layer are highlighted and presented. The deployment of the analysis patterns are illustrated and discussed using an AMR software case study. To verify the existence of the pattern in AMR systems, pattern-based reverse engineering was performed on two existing AMR systems. The reuse potential of these patterns is evaluated by measuring the reusability of components in the analysis patterns.},

This paper presents a method of design pattern application support in software projects. The method reduces problems found in traditional tools and contributes to design pattern instantiation at more levels of abstraction. The elaborated method is based on semantics defined via UML profile and transformations of models. Semantics defined via UML profile support specialization of pattern instances and model transformations support and automate the concretization of design pattern instances. The method supports the variation and customization of design patterns and also puts into practice ideas of model driven, iterative and incremental development of software systems. Moreover, the transformation of models is driven by models of design patterns. So the method is not limited only to design pattern support but also provides technique for the creation and addition of support of another custom model structures which are often created in models mechanically.},

Empirical studies show that it is commonly at the business process level that customers and end users are able to express their security needs.

Since many security notions belongs conceptually to the world of business processes, it is natural to try to capture and express them in the context of business models in which moreover customers and end users feel most comfortable. In this paper, based on experience drawn from an ongoing work within the CASENET project [1], we propose a UML-based business process-driven framework for the development of security-critical systems.},
