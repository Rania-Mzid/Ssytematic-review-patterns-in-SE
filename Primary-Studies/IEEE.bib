  abstract = {Novel models and tools are required to support the engineering of systems that are self-aware of their current situations and capable of dynamically modifying their behavior and structure using feedback loops. In this paper, with the help of a case study in the area of e-mobility and based on our past work in self-adaptive systems modeling, we introduce a new tool (i.e., an Eclipse-based simulation plug-in) that we are developing for engineering and simulating architectural patterns based on feedback loops. Our plug-in can facilitate modeling of self-adaptive patterns using UML 2, visual animation of behavior to expose run-time information, animating composite structure, model-level debugging, simulating eventdriven models, and run-time prompting.},

  abstract = {Internet of things (IoT) provides services which are environmentally event-driven. IoT provides sensing services of the physical environment to the information space, which is Event driven in common practice. For the development of IoT based application Software engineers need to assess the sensitivity of the data perceived by the physical devices. Commonly security is taken as a nonfunctional requirement but security requirements are as critical as other requirements. Authorization is one of the properties of security which is critical in context to Event Driven i.e. authorization of events and authorization of event generating devices. This research describes eight security patterns Documentation of Security Goal Pattern, Choose the Right Stuff, Third Party Enrollment Pattern, Reference Monitor pattern, Access matrix authorization rules, Role Based Access Control, Remote Authenticator/Authorizer, for authentication of the users, events and event generating devices to ensure its privilege to be in the system and perform actions.},

  abstract = {The international standard IEC 61499 for the design of distributed industrial control systems defines an abstract model of function blocks (FB) which allows many different semantic interpretations. As a consequence, in addition, so-called execution models were proposed to specify the execution order of FBs. The variety of models leads to the incompatibility of tools and hinders the portability of automation software. To achieve a degree of execution model independence, in this paper, design patterns are suggested that make FB systems-robust to changes of execution semantics. A semantic-robust pattern is defined for a particular source execution model. The patterns themselves are implemented by means of the FB apparatus and therefore are fairly universal. The patterns can be defined and implemented using the FB transformations expressed in terms of Attributed Graph Grammars.},

  abstract = {In order to bake security into application design, we introduce an adaptation to the Command pattern: command instances are tagged with the permissions required to perform them for each object they manipulate. Prior to executing a command instance issued by a given user, an execution engine validates the user has the required permissions over the objects the command is about to operate on. Stating the required permissions can often be declarative. In addition to the usual advantages offered by the command pattern (such as standardized operation handling), this adaptation creates a single checkpoint for validating permissions throughout the application. This, in turn, enhances application security and reduces code duplication, for example between the API and UI controllers. Disadvantages include the lack of framework support, and a learning curve for existing developers. We have used this design in implementing Dataverse, a widely-used institutional data repository developed at Harvard University, which has been in production use since May 2015. As this design differs significantly from common web application design, we also look at how the development team adapted to it, and at how using it affected our development process.},

Consequently, software developers need to tailor project specific methodologies to fit their methodology requirements. Process patterns present a suitable solution by providing reusable method chunks of software development methodologies for constructing methodologies to fit specific requirements. In this paper, we propose a set of high-level service-oriented process patterns that can be used for constructing and enhancing situational service-oriented methodologies. We show how these patterns are used to construct a specific service-oriented methodology for the development of a sample system.},

This approach bases the SPL software architecture on software architectural patterns and relates these patterns to SPL features. The paper describes how this approach has been applied to an unmanned space flight SPL.},

This paper also provides a description of the tool VULCAN and its implementation. By automating the design pattern generation process through the application of a practical and easily usable tool, the adoption of a model-driven engineering approach using design patterns can be substantially mitigated, resulting in improved system quality.},

The pattern definition has been realized from a comparative analysis of the Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats of a number of real case studies developed in different contexts. As a result, we have obtained an architectural pattern composed by several layers and a set of external elements that provides a solution to the main problems identified in the development of technological ecosystems. The pattern has been tested in a real context, concretely in the Public Administration, its which has demonstrated that works properly.},
