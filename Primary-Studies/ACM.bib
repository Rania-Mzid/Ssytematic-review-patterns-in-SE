  abstract = {Design patterns have a key role in the software development process. They describe both structure, behavior of classes and their relationships. During the maintenance phase, architects can benefit from knowing the underlying software design choices made during the implementation. Moreover, design patterns can improve software documentation, speed up the development process and enable large-scale reuse of software architectures. This paper presents a Multiple Levels Detection Approach (MLDA) to recover design pattern instances from Java source code. The novelty behind MLDA is its ability to extract design pattern instances based on a generated class level representation of an investigated system. Specifically, MLDA presents what is the so-called Structural Search Model (SSM) which incrementally builds the structure of each design pattern based on the generated source code model. As the experiment results illustrate, MLDA is able to extract 22 design patterns with reasonable detection accuracy.},

  abstract = {Designing software applications for multiple tenants is challenging. The task is even harder when designing pure multitenancy applications that must support different customers using a single codebase and data store. One of the most common problems when developing these systems is to support different graphical user interface not only for different users but also tenants. This critical requirement also applies to context-aware applications in which different graphical user interface should be presented to each user according to the user's context or software components and platforms that should allow developers easily to create different looks and feel for their applications. In this paper, we propose an architecture pattern for modeling graphical user interface that support different customizations and configurations. The modularity, the reusability and the maintainability of the pattern were evaluated by qualitative analysis based on wellknown patterns used in the proposed architecture pattern. Real world systems were built to validate the applicability, the correctness, the security and the performance of the pattern. We believe that our pattern will be useful for software providers as well as normal organizations when building software components or software systems for different customers or creating multitenancy applications in a cloud-based environment or building context-aware applications.},

However, empirical results suggest that patterns may sometimes support and other times hurt a quality attribute. Thus, there is a need for guidance on when a pattern is beneficial and when it is not. To provide such guidance, we propose a theoretical model for understanding the effect of patterns on quality. The obtained results are expected to improve the theoretical body of knowledge on design patterns, and facilitate informed decision making about when to insert or remove a pattern from a system. As an example, we present and discuss the results of modeling and exploring the effect of Decorator instances on quality. The results suggest that Decorator instances that are not expected to evolve through the addition of components in composite objects decrease system cohesion and therefore, modularity and maintainability are weakened.},

  abstract = {Mobile app development now represents a significant part of the software industry, with Android being the largest ecosystem. Android development comes with its own design practices and templates (layouts, activities, etc.). Developers also use different established architectural patterns for designing interactive software such as MVC, MVP and MVVM. They implement these patterns based on their understanding and experience. Thus, the choice and the implementation of such patterns varies from a developer to another. To the best of our knowledge, there is no work that provides a comprehensive view of the use of these patterns in mobile apps. Moreover, there is no clear understanding of which pattern to use and what is the trend for designing mobile apps using such patterns. In this paper, we propose an automatic approach to identify which MVC-based architectural pattern (MVC, MVP and MVVM) is used predominantly in a given app. For this purpose, we defined each of these patterns through a number of heuristics according to the pattern's potential implementations within the Android framework. We conducted an empirical study on a large set of mobile apps downloaded from the Google Play Store. We found, not surprisingly, a dominance of the popular MVC pattern, a rare use of MVP while MVVM is almost unused and a significant number of apps do not follow any pattern. The empirical study also enabled us to analyse the use of these patterns by domain, size and last-update date of the apps. We observed that MVC has been the most used pattern over the past years and it continues to gain popularity, and that small-size apps are mostly the ones that do not use any pattern.},

To do this we need to start with high-level models that represent the security policies of the institution. We present patterns that derive from traditional models: first, the Policy-Based Access Control which models how to decide if a subject is authorized to access an object according to policies defined in a central policy repository. Then we present implementation-oriented patterns that implement the Access Matrix or RBAC model: The ACL pattern allows control access to objects by indicating which subjects can access an object and in what way. There is usually an ACL associated with each object. The Capability pattern allows control access to objects by providing a credential or ticket to be given to a subject for accessing an object in a specific way. Capabilities are given to the principal.},

It also adds to the small but growing body of quantitative evidence on the effects of aspectization on the modularity of security pattern code.},

  abstract = {A key challenge facing IT organizations today is their evolution towards adopting e-business practices that gives rise to the need for reengineering their underlying software systems. Any reengineering effort has to be aware of the functional requirements of the subject system, in order not to violate the integrity of its intended uses. However, as software systems get regularly maintained throughout their lifecycle, the documentation of their requirements often become obsolete or get lost. To address this problem of ``software requirements loss'', we have developed an interaction-pattern mining method for the recovery of functional requirements as usage scenarios. Our method analyzes traces of the run-time system-user interaction to discover frequently recurring patterns; these patterns correspond to the functionality currently exercised by the system users, represented as usage scenarios. The discovered scenarios provide the basis for reengineering the software system into web-accessible components, each one supporting one of the discovered scenarios. In this paper, we describe IPM2, our interaction-pattern discovery algorithm, we illustrate it with a case study from a real application and we give an overview of the reengineering process in the context of which it is employed.},

To address variability across a DRE domain, software product line concepts are used to categorize and organize the features and design patterns. The software architectures produced are also validated through design time simulation. This research is applied and validated using the space flight software (FSW) domain.},

In the FSW domain, there exists a significant amount of variability in the required capabilities. For example, some FSW have a significant amount of hardware to control and operate in a nearly autonomous fashion. In contrast, other FSW have a small amount of hardware to control and rely heavily of commanding from the ground station to operate the spacecraft. The underlying architecture and component interactions needed for the different FSWs are quite different. This amount of architectural variability makes it difficult to develop a SPL architecture that covers the all possible variability in the FSW domain. Therefore, this paper presents a practical solution to this real world problem that leverages software product line concepts and software architectural design patterns.},

If they are not new patterns, it is still worthwhile to document them as modern uses of legacy architecture patterns. This paper briefly describes the patterns found and gives their frequency. It also describes three of the web services architecture patterns in detail.},

  abstract = {Software design is a complex activity. A successful designer requires knowledge and training in specific design techniques combined with practical experience. Designing a dimensional model embodies this challenge. This paper presents Dimensional Design Patterns (DDPs) and their applications to the design of dimensional models. We describe a metamodel of the DDPs and show their integration into Kimball's dimensional modeling design process so they can be applied to design problems using a known practice. By providing a metamodel and a method for DDP use, we combine theory and a practical design technique with the goal of increasing the efficiency and effectiveness of the software designer. The initial experimental results regarding the classroom use of DDPs revealed a significant increase in the efficiency of students to design a dimensional model, but more testing is necessary in order to evaluate the effectiveness measure.},
