  abstract = {Design patterns have a key role in the software development process. They describe both structure, behavior of classes and their relationships. During the maintenance phase, architects can benefit from knowing the underlying software design choices made during the implementation. Moreover, design patterns can improve software documentation, speed up the development process and enable large-scale reuse of software architectures. This paper presents a Multiple Levels Detection Approach (MLDA) to recover design pattern instances from Java source code. The novelty behind MLDA is its ability to extract design pattern instances based on a generated class level representation of an investigated system. Specifically, MLDA presents what is the so-called Structural Search Model (SSM) which incrementally builds the structure of each design pattern based on the generated source code model. As the experiment results illustrate, MLDA is able to extract 22 design patterns with reasonable detection accuracy.},

  abstract = {Designing software applications for multiple tenants is challenging. The task is even harder when designing pure multitenancy applications that must support different customers using a single codebase and data store. One of the most common problems when developing these systems is to support different graphical user interface not only for different users but also tenants. This critical requirement also applies to context-aware applications in which different graphical user interface should be presented to each user according to the user's context or software components and platforms that should allow developers easily to create different looks and feel for their applications. In this paper, we propose an architecture pattern for modeling graphical user interface that support different customizations and configurations. The modularity, the reusability and the maintainability of the pattern were evaluated by qualitative analysis based on wellknown patterns used in the proposed architecture pattern. Real world systems were built to validate the applicability, the correctness, the security and the performance of the pattern. We believe that our pattern will be useful for software providers as well as normal organizations when building software components or software systems for different customers or creating multitenancy applications in a cloud-based environment or building context-aware applications.},

However, empirical results suggest that patterns may sometimes support and other times hurt a quality attribute. Thus, there is a need for guidance on when a pattern is beneficial and when it is not. To provide such guidance, we propose a theoretical model for understanding the effect of patterns on quality. The obtained results are expected to improve the theoretical body of knowledge on design patterns, and facilitate informed decision making about when to insert or remove a pattern from a system. As an example, we present and discuss the results of modeling and exploring the effect of Decorator instances on quality. The results suggest that Decorator instances that are not expected to evolve through the addition of components in composite objects decrease system cohesion and therefore, modularity and maintainability are weakened.},

  abstract = {Mobile app development now represents a significant part of the software industry, with Android being the largest ecosystem. Android development comes with its own design practices and templates (layouts, activities, etc.). Developers also use different established architectural patterns for designing interactive software such as MVC, MVP and MVVM. They implement these patterns based on their understanding and experience. Thus, the choice and the implementation of such patterns varies from a developer to another. To the best of our knowledge, there is no work that provides a comprehensive view of the use of these patterns in mobile apps. Moreover, there is no clear understanding of which pattern to use and what is the trend for designing mobile apps using such patterns. In this paper, we propose an automatic approach to identify which MVC-based architectural pattern (MVC, MVP and MVVM) is used predominantly in a given app. For this purpose, we defined each of these patterns through a number of heuristics according to the pattern's potential implementations within the Android framework. We conducted an empirical study on a large set of mobile apps downloaded from the Google Play Store. We found, not surprisingly, a dominance of the popular MVC pattern, a rare use of MVP while MVVM is almost unused and a significant number of apps do not follow any pattern. The empirical study also enabled us to analyse the use of these patterns by domain, size and last-update date of the apps. We observed that MVC has been the most used pattern over the past years and it continues to gain popularity, and that small-size apps are mostly the ones that do not use any pattern.},

Then we present implementation-oriented patterns that implement the Access Matrix or RBAC model: The ACL pattern allows control access to objects by indicating which subjects can access an object and in what way. There is usually an ACL associated with each object. The Capability pattern allows control access to objects by providing a credential or ticket to be given to a subject for accessing an object in a specific way. Capabilities are given to the principal.},

  abstract = {A key challenge facing IT organizations today is their evolution towards adopting e-business practices that gives rise to the need for reengineering their underlying software systems. Any reengineering effort has to be aware of the functional requirements of the subject system, in order not to violate the integrity of its intended uses. However, as software systems get regularly maintained throughout their lifecycle, the documentation of their requirements often become obsolete or get lost. To address this problem of ``software requirements loss'', we have developed an interaction-pattern mining method for the recovery of functional requirements as usage scenarios. Our method analyzes traces of the run-time system-user interaction to discover frequently recurring patterns; these patterns correspond to the functionality currently exercised by the system users, represented as usage scenarios. The discovered scenarios provide the basis for reengineering the software system into web-accessible components, each one supporting one of the discovered scenarios. In this paper, we describe IPM2, our interaction-pattern discovery algorithm, we illustrate it with a case study from a real application and we give an overview of the reengineering process in the context of which it is employed.},

For example, some FSW have a significant amount of hardware to control and operate in a nearly autonomous fashion. In contrast, other FSW have a small amount of hardware to control and rely heavily of commanding from the ground station to operate the spacecraft. The underlying architecture and component interactions needed for the different FSWs are quite different. This amount of architectural variability makes it difficult to develop a SPL architecture that covers the all possible variability in the FSW domain. Therefore, this paper presents a practical solution to this real world problem that leverages software product line concepts and software architectural design patterns.},

Designing a dimensional model embodies this challenge. This paper presents Dimensional Design Patterns (DDPs) and their applications to the design of dimensional models. We describe a metamodel of the DDPs and show their integration into Kimball's dimensional modeling design process so they can be applied to design problems using a known practice. By providing a metamodel and a method for DDP use, we combine theory and a practical design technique with the goal of increasing the efficiency and effectiveness of the software designer. The initial experimental results regarding the classroom use of DDPs revealed a significant increase in the efficiency of students to design a dimensional model, but more testing is necessary in order to evaluate the effectiveness measure.},

Further, the running application can be dynamically reconfigured by monitoring the application for possible violations in the agreed QoS requirements. This paper advocates the use of various patterns to facilitate such dynamic reconfiguration in the various layers of the SOA Reference Architecture. Towards this objective, Family of Adapters pattern has been used in the service component layer to achieve dynamic switching between different versions of the same service without human intervention. In addition, an SOA design pattern has been employed in the business process layer to enhance the efficiency of the application. This pattern based approach has been tested by applying it to a sample SOA based e-Shopping application case study.},

Such user interfaces are able to adapt their behavior depending on who is interacting. However, existing implementations, mostly as software toolkits, are still ad-hoc and mostly based on existing GUI toolkits which are not designed to support user differentiation. The problem is that the development of IA interfaces is more complex than the development of traditional UIs and still requires extra programming efforts. To address these issues, we present a set of implementation models, named IOWAState models, to specify the behavior as state machines, the architecture and the components of IA interfaces. In addition, based on our IOWAState models and a classification of IA user interfaces, we detail a set of design patterns to implement the behavior of IA user interfaces.},

For performance analysis, a performance model can be generated from the SOA design and used to predict its performance. The impact of the design patterns is also reflected in the performance model. It is helpful to be able to trace the causality from the design pattern to its predicted performance impact. This paper describes a technique for automatically refactoring a SOA design model by applying a design pattern and for propagating the incremental changes to its LQN performance model. A SOA design model is expressed in UML extended with two standard profiles: SoaML for expressing SOA solutions and MARTE for performance annotations. The SOA design pattern is specified using a Role Based Modeling Language (RBML) and their application is automated using QVT-O. Automated incremental transformations are explored and evaluated for effectiveness on a case study example.},

This research considers how to characterize the performance impact of a SOA design pattern, which includes characterizing some aspects of the design and usage environment as a whole (for example, the scale of the workload and the availability of concurrent platforms for the eventual deployment). The approach uses performance models to characterize the application and the impact of the pattern on it. The planned approach exploits the context of model driven engineering (MDE) to give rapid feedback to developers about the potential impact of a pattern. Model transformations are used to generate the performance model, and to propagate the effect of applying a SOA design pattern to the performance model. The approach is sketched here with a preliminary case study, demonstrating its feasibility.},

This paper presents this approach for the development of human-robot collaboration, focusing on a recently added component: the application of interaction design patterns to capture and share design knowledge on the shape of the human-robot interaction (i.e., the communication level). The sCE case study in the urban search and rescue domain provided the specification and assessment of functions and shape of a team-awareness display. Twenty fire fighters participated as operator of a ground or aerial robot, in several realistic earth quake scenarios to assess the functions and shapes of this display in different settings. It showed that the functions (i.e., the task level requirements and rationale) were valid, while the shape (communication level) was (yet) suboptimal. Based on this evaluation result, a design improvement on the communication level has been proposed without the need to adjust the task-level design solution.},

At this phase, the Real-Time Operating System (RTOS) may not be chosen, hence some assumptions on the software platform are made to achieve timing verifications such as schedulability analysis of tasks describing the application. Among these assumptions, the synchronization protocol which is used to manage the concurrent access to resources that are shared between tasks. A classical solution is to consider the Priority Ceiling Protocol (PCP) synchronization protocol to avoid deadlocks. However, when this protocol is not provided by the target RTOS on which the application will be deployed, the concurrency model becomes not implementable and a new synchronization protocol must be considered. In this paper, we propose the Shared Resource Merge Pattern (SRMP) which aims to prevent deadlocks when the use of PCP protocol is not allowed by the target RTOS. The application of this pattern on the concurrency model must guarantee that the timing properties of the real-time application are still met.},

To have a good and reusable system, designers and developers must be aware of large information set and many quality concerns, e.g., design patterns. Systems with correct design pattern may ensure easy maintenance and evolution. However, without assistance, designing and development of software systems following certain design patterns is difficult for engineers. Recommendation systems for software engineering can assist designers and developers with a wide range of activities including suggesting design patterns. With the help of pattern recommenders, designers can come up with a reusable design. We provide a Design Pattern Recommender (DPR) process overview for software design to suggest design patterns, based on a simple Goal-Question-Metric (GQM) approach. Our prototype provides two-fold solution. In the primary-level, DPR only proposes one or more design patterns for a problem context, and in the secondary level, for a initial set of design, DPR refactors models and suggests design patterns. Our preliminary evaluation shows that DPR has a good trade-off between accuracy and procedural complexity, comparing to other state-of-the-art approaches.},

Design patterns are best practices for addressing recurring design problems in object-oriented source code. In the practice of implementing an SPL, instances of certain design patterns are employed to handle variability, which makes these ``variability-aware design patterns'' a best practice for SPL design. However, there currently is no dedicated method for proactively developing SPLs using design patterns suitable for realizing variable functionality. In this paper, we present a method to perform generative SPL development with design patterns. We use role models to capture design patterns and their relation to a variability model. We further allow mapping of individual design pattern roles to elements of realization artifacts to be generated (e.g., classes, methods) and check the conformance of the realization with the specification of the pattern. With this method, we support proactive development of SPLs using design patterns to apply best practices for the realization of variability. We present an implementation of our approach within the Eclipse IDE and demonstrate it within a case study.},

  abstract = {The stable design pattern AnyCorrectiveAction is based on the term Corrective Action [1], which generally refers to any counter measure taken by any party, who seeks Maintenance by the solution to any problem. Maintenance can be of different types: Preventive, Adaptive, Predictive and Corrective. Any Party decides upon taking any Corrective action, based on any evidence and the reason, and also the criteria that govern it. It involves one or more counter measures taken to prevent the recurrence of the problem or the reason for the corrective action. At the end of it, a log is produced, which serves as a basis for verification of the fact that the corrective action has been accomplished and it meets the ultimate goal of maintenance. This paper aims at applying the Software Stability Model [2] approach towards modeling a system that has to perform maintenance, by employing a Corrective Action and come up with a stable pattern, which can form a part of such a system, focusing at applying corrective action in a holistic way, rather than tying it on only one application specific context, which might cause potential impedance mismatch between process and workflows at a later stage. The Software Stability Model ensures high reusability, ensuring that a design once created can be used to model any application, in any domain, thus making the task of designing more efficient, and the modeled system, largely domain independent [3]. The goal of this paper is to design a Stable Pattern for Corrective Action and to model the system on the basis on an Enduring Business Theme. Here, the ultimate goal or the EBT is Maintenance and AnyCorrective action is what acts as a workhorse to achieve the goal of maintenance. In this paper, we have first designed a model, which defines the relationship between the Enduring Business Theme through Business Objects. We have then gone ahead with modeling an application scenario, which portrays the reusability of the developed stable pattern. A comparison of the Traditional Model and the Stable Model has also been included to describe how the latter overcomes to drawbacks of the former. Different models, such as, use cases, CRC cards, class diagrams and sequence diagrams have been used to give a better insight into the pattern and possible applications of it.},

Several design patterns and principles are defined to improve the design quality of object-oriented software systems. In addition, designers can use unique design motifs which are particular for the specific application domain. Another common habit is cloning and modifying some parts of the software while creating new modules. Therefore, object-oriented programs can include many identical design structures. This work proposes a sub-graph mining based approach to detect identical design structures in object-oriented systems. By identifying and analyzing these structures, we can obtain useful information about the design, such as commonly-used design patterns, most frequent design defects, domain-specific patterns, and design clones, which may help developers to improve their knowledge about the software architecture. Furthermore, problematic parts of frequent identical design structures are the appropriate refactoring opportunities because they affect multiple areas of the architecture. Experiments with several open-source projects show that we can successfully find many identical design structures in each project. We observe that usually most of the identical structures are an implementation of common design patterns; however we also detect various anti-patterns, domain-specific patterns, and design-level clones.},

Using a framework for creating applications is not a trivial task, however, and special tools are needed for supporting the process. Tool support, in turn, requires explicit specification of the reuse interfaces of frameworks. Unfortunately these specifications typically become quite extensive and complex for non-trivial frameworks. In this paper we discuss the possibility to reverse engineer a reuse interface specification from a framework's and its example applications' source code. We also introduce a programming environment that supports both making and using such specifications. In our environment, the reuse interface modeling is supported by a concept analysis based reverse engineering technique described in this paper.},

Building upon that approach, this paper introduces a pattern-based architecting process that aims at inexpensively documenting design decisions in the architectural views alongside the natural flow of design. The decisions that are made explicit, concern the selection of patterns, their variants and the corresponding primitives, as well as the resolution of inconsistencies between the architectural views. The approach is demonstrated in the domain of process-driven SOA for two architectural views: Component-and-Connector and Process Flow.},

Typical problems that arise in many business domains are for instance missing central control, complex cooperation models, complex lookup models, or issues regarding dynamic deployment. We used a pattern-based approach to identify the well working solutions in the different technologies for loosely coupled services. Then we reused this design knowledge in our concept for a service-oriented middleware. This concept is centered around a controlled environment, called a federation. Each remote object (a peer service) is controlled in one or more federations, but within this environment peers can collaborate in a simple-to-use, loosely coupled, and ad hoc style of communication. A semantic lookup service is used to let the peers publish rich metadata about themselves to their fellow peers.},
