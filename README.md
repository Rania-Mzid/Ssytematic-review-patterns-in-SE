# Research Landscape of Patterns in Software Engineering : A Systematic Literature Review
## Context
Software system development is a challenging task. Pattern-based development has been effectively employed to simplify and accelerate the development of high-quality systems. In general, a pattern is described as a context-specific solution to a recurrent problem. They consequently offer an important platform for experience sharing and reuse.
## Objective 
The objective of this study is to provide a comprehensive survey of the literature reporting findings from diverse research communities and domains with regard to pattern concept in software engineering.
## Method
We conducted a systematic literature review based on three digital libraries and following a standard methodology.
## Results 
The search identified 129 relevant papers. We derived a taxonomy from the reviewed studies. This taxonomy provides researchers with a structured review of the state-of-the-art in patterns in the software engineering field, which may help new researchers in the field position their work and open a gateway to new pattern-based approaches. We used the proposed taxonomy to classify and analyze primary studies to offer quantitative and qualitative results. In order to help researchers consolidate their pattern-based approaches, recommendations for future directions are also given.
## Conclusion
Different communities in the field of software engineering use the pattern concept. Pattern-based approaches are mature in some areas but are just getting started in others. The study recommends standardizing pattern descriptions and establishing explicit conventions for pattern type definitions. The study proposes to reinforce the research field with feedback and success stories on the use of patterns in an industrial context.
