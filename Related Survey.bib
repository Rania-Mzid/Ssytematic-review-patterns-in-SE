  abstract = {Gang of Four (GoF) design patterns are widely approved solutions for recurring software design problems, and their benefits to software quality are extensively studied. However, the occurrence of bad smells in design patterns increases the crisis of degenerating design patterns' structure and behavior. Their occurrences are detrimental to the benefits of design patterns and they influence software sustainability by increasing maintenance costs and energy consumption. Despite the destructive roles of bad smells in such designs, there are an absence of studies systematically reviewing bad smells of GoF design patterns. This study systematically reviews a 10-year state of the art sample, identifying 16 studies investigating this phenomenon. Following a thorough evaluation of the full contents, we observed that the occurrence of bad smells have been investigated in proportion to four granularity levels of analysis: Design level, category level, pattern level, and role level. We identified 28 bad smells, categorized under code smells and grime symptoms, and emphasized their relationship with GoF pattern types and categories. The utilization of design pattern bad smell detection approaches and datasets were also discussed. Consequently, we observed that the research phenomenon is growing intensively, with a prominent focus of studies analyzing code smell occurrences rather than grime occurrences, at various granularity levels. Finally, we uncovered research gaps and areas with significant potentials for future research.},

The main contributions are as follows: (a) identifying research topics in design patterns, (b) quantifying the research emphasis on each topic, and (c) describing the demographics of design patterns research. The last secondary study with similar goals in the design patterns field considers the Gang of Four design patterns only. However, the scope of the current study is all of the design patterns. Moreover, our review covers about six additional years and a larger number of publications and venues. In this systematic mapping study, a total of 2775 papers were identified as relevant, and 637 of them were included. According to the results, design patterns can be classified into six different research topics. As a consequence, it is concluded that Pattern Development, Pattern Mining, and Pattern Usage are the most active topics in the field of design patterns.},

Method: We perform a systematic, accurate literature review of published studies focusing on the object oriented implementation of state machine specifications. Results: The systematic review is based on a comprehensive set of 53 resources in all, which we have classified into two groups: pattern-based and not pattern-based. For each proposal, we have analysed both the state machine specification elements they support and the means the authors propose for their implementation. Additionally, the review investigates which proposals take into account desirable features to be considered in software development such as maintenance or reusability. Conclusions: One of the conclusions drawn from the review is that most of the analysed works are based on a software design pattern. Another key finding is that many papers neither support several of the main components of the expressive richness of state machine specifications nor provide an implementation strategy that considers relevant qualitative aspects in software development.},

High quality software systems typically apply expert design experience which has been captured as design patterns. As demonstrated solutions to recurring problems, design patterns help to reuse expert experience in software system design. They have been extensively applied in the industry. Mining the instances of design patterns from the source code of software systems can assist in the understanding of the systems and the process of re-engineering them. More importantly, it also helps to trace back to the original design decisions, which are typically missing in legacy systems. This paper presents a review on current techniques and tools for mining design patterns from source code or design of software systems. We classify different approaches and analyze their results in a comparative study. We also examine the disparity of the discovery results of different approaches and analyze possible reasons with some insight.},

  abstract = {Design patterns play a significant role in reverse engineering by providing information not only on how but also on why a solution has been implemented in a specific way because of their semantics. The application of design patterns leads to their personalization to a specific context, hence to the generation of variants. This makes their recognition a challenging task, which may be addressed through the understanding and detection of the micro-structures design patterns are made of. This is very useful for the detection as well as for the application of design patterns. The principal aim of this paper is to present a survey on these micro-structures and a comparison among them in the perspective of reverse engineering. Because of their less complex structure and behavior, as well as closer link to the source code, the recognition of these micro-structures may be automated, which can be considered a step towards the automatic recognition of the more complex design patterns. In this paper, we consider four of the most significant types of micro-structures: elemental design patterns, clues, sub-patterns, and micro patterns. To analyze the role of the micro-structures in the design pattern detection process, we make a comparison among these four types of micro-structures and among the micro-structures of various types in order to identify the relations among them.

We propose an outline template for analysis patterns that strongly supports the whole analysis process from the requirements analysis to the analysis model and further on to its transformation into a flexible and reusable design and implementation. As an example we develop a family of analysis patterns in this paper that deal with a series of pressing problems in cooperative work, collaborative information filtering and sharing, and knowledge management. We evaluate the reuse potential of these patterns by analyzing several components of an information system, that was developed for the Virtual University project of the Vienna University of Economics and Business Administration. The findings of this analysis suggest that using patterns in the analysis phase has the potential to reducing development time significantly by introducing reuse already at the analysis stage and by improving the interface between analysis and design phase.},

However, the diversity of terminology used means that the full potential of these review types may be lost amongst a confusion of indistinct and misapplied terms. The objective of this study is to provide descriptive insight into the most common types of reviews, with illustrative examples from health and health information domains. Methods: Following scoping searches, an examination was made of the vocabulary associated with the literature of review and synthesis (literary warrant). A simple analytical framework\textemdash Search, AppraisaL, Synthesis and Analysis (SALSA)\textemdash was used to examine the main review types. Results: Fourteen review types and associated methodologies were analysed against the SALSA framework, illustrating the inputs and processes of each review type. A description of the key characteristics is given, together with perceived strengths and weaknesses. A limited number of review types are currently utilized within the health information domain. Conclusions: Few review types possess prescribed and explicit methodologies and many fall short of being mutually exclusive. Notwithstanding such limitations, this typology provides a valuable reference point for those commissioning, conducting, supporting or interpreting reviews, both within health information and the wider health care domain.},

The self-adaptive research domain provides adaptive capabilities that can support the integration in IoT systems. However, developing such systems is a challenging, error-prone, and time-consuming task. In this context, design patterns propose already used and optimized solutions to specific problems in various contexts. Applying design patterns might help to reuse existing knowledge about similar development issues. However, so far, there is a lack of taxonomies on design patterns for self-adaptive systems. To tackle this issue, in this paper, we provide a taxonomy on design patterns for self-adaptive systems that can be transferred to support adaptivity in IoT systems. Besides describing the taxonomy and the design patterns, we discuss their applicability in an Industrial IoT case study.},

From more than a thousand of candidate papers, we have systematically distinguished and analyzed twenty-two (22) papers that have been published around patterns and architectures for IoT security (and privacy). Our analysis shows a rise in the number of publications tending to security patterns and architectures in the last two years. Within this rise, we see that most patterns and architectures are applicable for all IoT systems, while some are limited within specific domains. However, there are gaps in this research area that can be filled in to promote the utilization of patterns for IoT security and privacy.},

  abstract = {The impact of design patterns on quality attributes has been extensively evaluated in studies with different perspectives, objectives, metrics, and quality attributes, leading to contradictive and hard to compare results. Our objective is to explain these results by considering confounding factors, practices, metrics, or implementation issues that effect quality. Furthermore, there is a lack of research that connect design patterns evaluations to patterns development studies. Accordingly, we also aim at providing an initiate on how patterns structure and implementation can be improved, to promote software quality.},

  abstract = {Nowadays, software engineers have a great tendency to use design patterns (DPs) because they are considered to have an important role in software engineering in the sense that they can make the understanding of nonentities easier. However, most of the systems have no document helping engineers recognize DPs from the codes. As a result, different approaches for design pattern detection have been suggested. The current paper reviews different available literature on design pattern detection and reports a number of different aspects of them such as data representation, type of design pattern, advantages and disadvantages for different approaches, quantitative results, etc. The current paper reviews research studies published between 2008 until 2019 and represents a list of datasets used for evaluations. The present investigation paper is not only to lay the ground for the selection of the optimal design patterns, but also hopes to guide the future studies through raising awareness about the potential defects in the previous researches.},
